by Aakash Chandramouli <br />

Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Clicking will download the data")

## Goal of the Project

1. To create a tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
5. README File for the analysis


The run_analysis.R file is uploaded in the repo which can be viewed for the code to obtain the tidy data set.
